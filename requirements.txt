# This requirements.txt file is a merge of the original MegaTTS3 dependencies
# and additional dependencies required by the Gradio UI (`optimized_app_v1.py`).
# It is recommended to compare and merge this with the official MegaTTS3
# requirements.txt from the project's GitHub repository, prioritizing
# the versions specified in the official file where conflicts exist.

# --- Assumed Core MegaTTS3 Dependencies (Verify against official requirements.txt) ---
